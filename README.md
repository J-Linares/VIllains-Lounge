 Game Server Hosting site, Web dev Playground
 This project serves as a simple area to test and learn several different web technologies.

this is purely something i build in my spare time for fun.
if this project were to ever be deployed, it would serve its purpose as an information hub for ongoing games with the people responsible for hosting the game servers.

XAMPP is absolutely required for viewing and managing the website.
this site will not run without a database which is mainly hosted through xampp.
